The project aimed to develop Machine Learning models to carry out early detection of breast cancer in women using various types of biomarkers such as BMI, Glucose, Insulin, HOMA, Leptin, Adiponectin, Resistin and MCP-1. The data to train/test the models was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra). The work done in this project is based on the work of Miguel Patrício, José Pereira, Joana Crisóstomo, Paulo Matafome, Manuel Gomes, Raquel Seiça & Francisco Caramelo in their paper titled "Using Resistin, glucose, age and BMI to predict the presence of breast cancer". Please refer the same for extensive details of their work on the same. (https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3877-1)
